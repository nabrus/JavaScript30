    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2); // 100 100
    age = 200; 
    console.log(age, age2); // 200 100

    let name = "Steve";
    let name2 = name;
    console.log(name, name2); // Steve Steve
    name = "StevenUrban";
    console.log(name, name2); // StevenUrban Steve 

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    let team = players;

    console.log(players, team); // ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"]
                                // ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"]

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = "Wyatt";

    console.log(team, players); // ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Wyatt"]
                                // ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Wyatt"]

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // `team` is just a reference to the original array `players`. 
    // So the `players` gets updated when `team` is changed.

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    // Using `slice()` which makes a shallow copy of a portion (or all of
    // when used without begin or end parameters) of an array into a new
    // array. The original array will not be modified. 
    const team2 = players.slice();

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
